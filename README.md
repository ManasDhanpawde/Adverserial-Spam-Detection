# Adverserial-Spam-Detection


## Project Overview

This project implements a **Spam Email Classification System** using machine learning. The goal is to automatically classify emails as **spam** or **ham** (non-spam) based on their content. This system can be used to filter unwanted emails and improve email security.

At the start, you can implement this project by following these steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   Download the dataset from the provided link and load it into your Python environment. You can use libraries such as `pandas` to handle the CSV files.

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**  
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure (e.g., spam/ham distribution).  
   - Clean the text data: remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, handle missing values, etc.  
   - Optionally, perform tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and feature extraction (TF-IDF, bag-of-words, or word embeddings).

3. **Model Selection and Training**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Choose a classification algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, or an NLP-based deep learning model.  
   - Train the model on the training set and evaluate on the test set.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Use metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to measure model performance.  
   - Optionally, create a confusion matrix to visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

5. **Deployment (Optional)**  
   - Deploy the model as a web application or API to classify incoming emails in real-time.

## Example Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("spam.csv")  # your CSV file
X = df['text']
y = df['label']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Text vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train classifier
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
